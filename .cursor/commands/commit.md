# Commit current work
Commit current work.

## Important
- Prepend GIT_EDITOR=true to all git commands you run, especially the ones looking at diffs, so you can avoid getting blocked as you execute commands
- If you can't get any information from git diff, just using your working memory to determine what has changed

## Instructions
Review each file individually to make sure they're related to the work you just did, then write a brief commit message in the following format:

- Short title description (< 80 characters)
- 2~3 bullet points (< 80 characters) with a quick description

## Notes
- You should only commit work when instructed. Do not keep committing subsquent work unless explicitly told so

Optional: ask me if I would like to push the commit. (Only if I'm not on main)
