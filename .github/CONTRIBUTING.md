## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting:

```bash
# Check for issues
bun lint

# Auto-fix issues
bun lint:fix

# Format code
bun format
```

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript
- Prefer `type` over `interface` for component props
- Use absolute imports with `@/` alias
- Separate type imports: `import type { Props } from '...'`

### React Patterns

- Use functional components with arrow functions
- Prefer Server Components over Client Components when possible
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` for performance optimization
- Follow the component structure: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, types

### Audio Development

- **Audio Engine**: Built on [MediaBunny](https://mediabunny.dev) for browser-based processing
- **State Management**: Jotai for global state, React Query for server state
- **Real-time Processing**: Web Audio API with optimized performance

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run type checking
bun typecheck

# Run linting
bun lint

# Build the project
bun build
```

### Testing GitHub Workflows Locally

We use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to test GitHub Actions workflows locally before pushing. This saves time and prevents broken CI runs.

#### Prerequisites

1. **Install Docker** (required for act to run)
   - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for macOS/Windows
   - Docker Engine for Linux

2. **Install act**
   ```bash
   # macOS (Homebrew)
   brew install act

   # Windows (Chocolatey)
   choco install act-cli

   # Linux
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash
   ```

#### Running Workflows Locally

**Test CI workflow (lint, typecheck, build):**
```bash
# Run the full CI workflow
act -W .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Run with specific GitHub image (more accurate)
act -W .github/workflows/ci.yml -P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest

# Pass secrets for Turbo remote caching (optional)
act -W .github/workflows/ci.yml \
  -s TURBO_TOKEN=your_token \
  -s TURBO_TEAM=your_team
```

**Test Convex deploy workflow (production):**
```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will actually deploy to Convex if you provide real keys
act push -W .github/workflows/deploy-convex.yml \
  -P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest \
  -s CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=your_deploy_key \
  -s CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your_deployment_id

# Use --dryrun to test without executing
act push -W .github/workflows/deploy-convex.yml --dryrun
```

**Test Convex preview deploy:**
```bash
# Test preview deploy (requires ENABLE_CONVEX_PREVIEWS=1)
act pull_request -W .github/workflows/deploy-convex.yml \
  -P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest \
  -s CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=your_preview_key \
  -s CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your_preview_deployment \
  --var ENABLE_CONVEX_PREVIEWS=1
```

#### Common act Options

- `-W <workflow.yml>` - Specify which workflow to run
- `-P ubuntu-latest=<image>` - Override runner image
- `-s KEY=value` - Pass secrets
- `--var KEY=value` - Pass repository variables
- `-n` or `--dryrun` - Show what would run without executing
- `-l` - List available workflows and jobs
- `--job <job_name>` - Run a specific job only
- `-v` - Verbose output for debugging

#### Best Practices

1. **Always use --dryrun first** for deploy workflows to avoid accidental deployments
2. **Use catthehacker/ubuntu images** for better compatibility with GitHub Actions
3. **Test with real secrets in a safe environment** (e.g., preview/staging)
4. **Check Docker resources** - act can be resource-intensive; ensure Docker has enough RAM/CPU

#### Troubleshooting

**act fails to start:**
- Ensure Docker is running (`docker ps`)
- Try pulling the runner image manually: `docker pull catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest`

**Workflow differences from GitHub:**
- Some GitHub Actions features aren't fully supported by act
- Environment contexts may differ slightly
- Use GitHub's runner images for maximum accuracy

**Secrets not working:**
- Use `-s` flag, not `--secret` (older syntax)
- Check secret names match workflow exactly (case-sensitive)
- Use `--secret-file .secrets` for multiple secrets:
  ```bash
  # .secrets file format:
  CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=xxx
  TURBO_TOKEN=yyy
  ```
