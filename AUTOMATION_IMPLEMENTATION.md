# Automation System Implementation - Phase 1 Complete

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Core dB Conversion Utilities (`lib/audio/volume.ts`)
```typescript
// New functions
- multiplierToDb(multiplier: number) → dB
- dbToMultiplier(db: number) → multiplier
- getEffectiveDb(baseVolume%, envelopeMultiplier) → combined dB
- formatEffectiveDb() → formatted string
- clampAutomationDb() → safe range (-60 to +12 dB)
```

**Key Insight**: Envelope points store multipliers (0-4), but UI now shows dB values.
- Multiplier 1.0 = 0 dB (unity gain, no change)
- Multiplier 0.5 = -6 dB (half amplitude)
- Multiplier 2.0 = +6 dB (double amplitude)
- Multiplier 4.0 = +12 dB (4x amplitude)

### 2. EnvelopeEditor dB Display (`components/daw/inspectors/envelope-editor.tsx`)

**Before**:
```
0:01.000 → 300%
400% of base (75%)
```

**After**:
```
0:01.000 → +9.5 dB        (effective gain)
+9.5 dB envelope          (envelope contribution)
```

**Features**:
- Base volume shown in dB: "Base: -1.4 dB"
- Each point displays:
  - Time (mm:ss.mmm format)
  - Effective gain in dB (base + envelope)
  - Envelope contribution (how much automation adds/subtracts)
- Input field now labeled "Gain (dB)" with -60 to +12 dB range
- Step size: 0.5 dB (fine control)
- Tooltip shows both envelope dB and effective dB

### 3. Visual Polish
- Monospace font for time/gain values (better alignment)
- "Unity gain (no change)" indicator for 0 dB envelope points
- Positive dB shows with "+" prefix (e.g., "+6.0 dB")
- Negative dB shows with "-" (e.g., "-3.5 dB")
- Clean, professional typography

## How It Works Now

### User Perspective
1. **Set base volume** with slider (e.g., 75% = -1.4 dB)
2. **Add automation points** via + button
3. **Adjust each point in dB**:
   - Enter -6.0 dB to cut volume by half
   - Enter +6.0 dB to double volume
   - Enter 0.0 dB for no change (unity)
4. **See effective gain**: Base + envelope automation
5. **Visual feedback**: Amber dot on volume slider when envelope active

### Technical Flow
```
User Input (dB) → dbToMultiplier() → Store as multiplier
                                     ↓
                            PlaybackEngine uses multiplier
                                     ↓
Display (dB) ← multiplierToDb() ← Read from store
```

## What's Left to Implement

### Phase 2: Visual Automation Lane (Next Priority)
- [ ] SVG-based automation curve overlay on track grid
- [ ] Draggable points directly on waveform
- [ ] Click to add point at playhead
- [ ] Real-time playhead indicator showing current dB value

### Phase 3: Real-Time Feedback
- [ ] Live dB meter on volume slider during playback
- [ ] Current automation value indicator (follows playhead)
- [ ] Visual animation of automation curve during playback

### Phase 4: Advanced Controls
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+Click to add point, Delete to remove)
- [ ] Snap to grid for time values
- [ ] Copy/paste automation curves
- [ ] Undo/redo for automation edits
- [ ] Multiple point selection and drag

## User Benefits (Already Delivered)

✅ **dB Values Everywhere**: Industry-standard display, not confusing percentages  
✅ **Volume Down Support**: Can now set -6 dB, -12 dB, etc (was impossible before)  
✅ **Effective Gain Clarity**: See combined result of base + automation  
✅ **Professional Feel**: Matches Logic Pro's dB-centric workflow  
✅ **Precise Control**: 0.5 dB steps, -60 to +12 dB range  

## Migration Notes

**Backward Compatibility**: Existing automation points (stored as multipliers 0-4) work perfectly. The conversion happens in the UI layer:
- Storage: `value: 2.0` (multiplier)
- Display: "+6.0 dB" (converted for user)
- Audio Engine: Uses multiplier directly (no conversion needed)

No data migration required! Existing projects continue to work.

## Testing Checklist

- [x] EnvelopeEditor shows dB values
- [x] Base volume displays in dB
- [x] Effective gain calculation is correct
- [x] Can set negative dB (volume down)
- [x] Can set positive dB (volume up)
- [x] Unity gain (0 dB) clearly labeled
- [x] Tooltip shows both envelope and effective dB
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] No linter errors

## Next Steps

1. **Build AutomationLane component** (visual SVG curve on grid)
2. **Integrate with track grid** (overlay on waveform)
3. **Add direct manipulation** (drag points, click to add)
4. **Real-time playhead feedback** (show current dB during playback)
