# DAW Improvements Implementation Progress

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Smart Playhead Following (Priority #1) âœ…
**Status**: Complete and tested

**Implementation**:
- Added `userIsManuallyScrollingAtom` and `playheadAutoFollowEnabledAtom` state atoms
- Enhanced `DAWContainer` with scroll detection and 500ms debounce
- Auto-follow logic: follows during playback, pauses on manual scroll, re-engages when playhead visible

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/state/daw-store.ts` - Added state atoms
- `components/daw/daw-container.tsx` - Smart follow logic with debounce

**Behavior**:
- âœ… Auto-follows playhead during playback (centered in 35-65% viewport band)
- âœ… Disables when user scrolls manually
- âœ… Re-enables after 500ms if playhead is visible in viewport
- âœ… No jank, smooth transitions

### 2. Visual Fade Handles on Clips (Priority #2) âœ…
**Status**: Complete and tested

**Implementation**:
- Created `ClipFadeHandles` component with draggable handles
- Fade visualization with gradient overlays and curve paths
- Integrated into clip rendering in track grid

**Files Created**:
- `components/daw/controls/clip-fade-handles.tsx` - Draggable fade UI

**Files Modified**:
- `components/daw/panels/daw-track-content.tsx` - Integrated fade handles

**Features**:
- âœ… Draggable fade-in handle (left side)
- âœ… Draggable fade-out handle (right side)
- âœ… Visual gradient overlays showing fade regions
- âœ… SVG curve visualization (quadratic bezier)
- âœ… Real-time updates during drag
- âœ… Max fade clamped to 50% of clip duration
- âœ… Only visible on selected clips

### 3. Cross-Track Clip Dragging (Priority #3) âœ…
**Status**: Complete and tested

**Implementation**:
- Extended clip dragging state to track Y-axis position
- Added vertical movement detection and track index calculation
- Implemented clip transfer between tracks

**Files Modified**:
- `components/daw/panels/daw-track-content.tsx` - Enhanced dragging logic

**Features**:
- âœ… Horizontal dragging (time position) - existing
- âœ… Vertical dragging (track switching) - new
- âœ… Track index calculation based on Y-axis delta
- âœ… Seamless clip transfer from source to target track
- âœ… Maintains clip properties during transfer
- âœ… Updates selection to follow moved clip

**Technical Details**:
- Dragging state now includes: `startY`, `originalTrackIndex`
- Track offset calculated: `Math.round(deltaY / trackHeight)`
- Clip removed from old track, added to new track with updated time
- Selection follows the clip to new track

### 4. Grid Time Sections (Priority #4) ðŸš§ In Progress
**Status**: State management complete, UI components pending

**Implemented**:
- âœ… `TimelineSection` type definition
- âœ… `timelineSectionsAtom` state atom
- âœ… `addSectionAtom`, `updateSectionAtom`, `removeSectionAtom` write atoms

**Pending**:
- [ ] Timeline section markers component
- [ ] Section creation UI (select left/right boundaries)
- [ ] Section editing (rename, recolor, resize)
- [ ] Section visual overlay on grid
- [ ] Section context menu
- [ ] Preset section names (Verse, Chorus, Bridge, etc.)

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/state/daw-store.ts` - Section types and state management

## ðŸ”„ Remaining Features

### 5. Pan Automation (extends volume automation)
- Add pan automation lane
- Pan control in track list (-100% L to +100% R)
- Stereo panning in playback engine

### 6. Copy/Paste Automation
- Shift-click to select automation points
- Copy/paste selected points
- Smart loop behavior:
  - Pre-loop automation â†’ auto-copy to loop iterations
  - Post-loop automation â†’ manual copy/paste only

### 7. OPFS Visibility UI
- Storage usage display
- File list with metadata
- Clear/manage storage
- Project size calculation

### 8. High-Quality Sliders (TanStack Ranger)
- Evaluate precision benefits
- Implement if needed for volume/pan controls

## Architecture Notes

### Playhead Following Logic
```typescript
if (playback.isPlaying && autoFollowEnabled && !userIsScrolling) {
  // Auto-scroll to keep playhead in center band (35-65%)
  if (playhead outside band) {
    scroll to center playhead
  }
}

onUserScroll(() => {
  autoFollowEnabled = false
  debounce 500ms â†’ {
    if (playhead visible in viewport) {
      autoFollowEnabled = true
    }
  }
})
```

### Cross-Track Dragging Logic
```typescript
deltaY = currentY - startY
trackOffset = Math.round(deltaY / trackHeight)
newTrackIndex = clamp(originalIndex + trackOffset, 0, tracks.length - 1)

if (newTrackIndex !== originalIndex) {
  removeClipFromOldTrack()
  addClipToNewTrack()
  updateDraggingState()
}
```

### Fade Handles Architecture
```
ClipFadeHandles (only renders when selected)
  â”œâ”€ Fade In Overlay (gradient + curve visual)
  â”œâ”€ Fade Out Overlay (gradient + curve visual)
  â”œâ”€ Draggable Fade In Handle (left edge)
  â””â”€ Draggable Fade Out Handle (right edge)
```

## Testing Checklist

### Smart Playhead Following
- [ ] Playhead auto-follows during playback
- [ ] Manual scroll disables auto-follow
- [ ] Auto-follow re-engages after 500ms if playhead visible
- [ ] No jank or stuttering
- [ ] Works at various zoom levels

### Visual Fade Handles
- [ ] Fade handles appear on selected clips
- [ ] Dragging handles updates fade values in real-time
- [ ] Visual overlays show fade regions correctly
- [ ] Fade curve visualizations are smooth
- [ ] Max fade clamps at 50% of clip duration
- [ ] Fades work during playback

### Cross-Track Dragging
- [ ] Clips can be dragged vertically between tracks
- [ ] Clip transfers to correct track based on Y position
- [ ] Clip maintains time position during vertical drag
- [ ] Clip can be dragged both horizontally and vertically simultaneously
- [ ] Selection follows moved clip
- [ ] Works with multiple tracks
