# SDK Architecture Migration - Progress Report

## âœ… Phase 1 Complete: Bridge Layer & Event System

### Completed Tasks

1. **Bridge Layer** âœ…
   - Created `AudioServiceBridge` - wraps legacy audioService with SDK AudioEngine
   - Created `PlaybackServiceBridge` - wraps legacy playbackService with SDK Transport  
   - Integrated bridges into `DAWProvider` for app-wide access
   - Bidirectional event synchronization between old and new systems

2. **Event Synchronization** âœ…
   - `useTransportEvents` - Subscribe to Transport state changes
   - `useAudioEvents` - Subscribe to AudioEngine events
   - `usePlaybackSync` - Automatic atom sync with Transport
   - Updated `TransportEvent` type with `state` and `currentTime`
   - All Transport methods now dispatch complete events

3. **Infrastructure** âœ…
   - Both packages build successfully
   - Full monorepo builds without errors
   - Type-safe event handling
   - Clean separation of concerns

### Key Files Created

#### Bridges
- `packages/daw-react/src/bridges/audio-bridge.ts`
- `packages/daw-react/src/bridges/playback-bridge.ts`
- `packages/daw-react/src/bridges/index.ts`

#### Event Hooks
- `packages/daw-react/src/hooks/use-transport-events.ts`
- `packages/daw-react/src/hooks/use-audio-events.ts`
- `packages/daw-react/src/hooks/use-playback-sync.ts`
- `packages/daw-react/src/hooks/index.ts`

#### Updated
- `packages/daw-react/src/providers/daw-provider.tsx` - Now supports bridge injection
- `packages/daw-react/src/index.ts` - Exports bridges and event hooks
- `packages/daw-sdk/src/types/core.ts` - Enhanced `TransportEvent` interface
- `packages/daw-sdk/src/core/transport.ts` - Complete event emission

## ðŸ”„ Phase 2: State & Hook Migration (Ready to Start)

### Next Steps

The bridge layer enables gradual migration of state and hooks without breaking the app:

1. **Migrate Track Atoms** (Next)
   - Update `packages/daw-react/src/atoms/base.ts` to use bridges
   - Replace direct `playbackService` calls with bridge methods
   - Maintain same public API for components

2. **Migrate Playback Atoms**
   - Use `usePlaybackSync` hook for automatic sync
   - Remove manual playback state management
   - Event-driven updates instead of imperative calls

3. **Rewrite Hooks**
   - `use-clip-inspector` â†’ Use SDK types + bridges
   - `use-drag-interaction` â†’ Already framework-agnostic
   - `use-live-automation-gain` â†’ Use Transport events
   - `use-playback-sync` â†’ Already migrated (in new package)

4. **Component Migration**
   - Batch 1: Simple components (panels, controls)
   - Batch 2: Complex components (inspectors, timeline)
   - Batch 3: Remaining components

5. **Cleanup**
   - Remove `/apps/web/lib/daw-sdk` folder
   - Update all imports to use `@wav0/daw-react`
   - Remove bridge layer (no longer needed)

## ðŸ“Š Current State

### âœ… Working
- New SDK packages build successfully
- Bridge pattern allows coexistence
- Event system fully functional
- Full monorepo compiles

### ðŸ”„ In Migration
- State atoms still use old singletons (via bridges)
- Hooks still import from old SDK
- Components still import from old SDK
- 36 components need migration

### ðŸŽ¯ Not Yet Started
- Direct usage of new SDK in atoms
- Component import updates
- Old SDK removal
- Bundle optimization

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics So Far

âœ… Zero breaking changes introduced  
âœ… All existing functionality preserved  
âœ… Type-safe migration path established  
âœ… Bidirectional compatibility maintained  
âœ… Event-driven architecture foundation ready  

## ðŸ“ˆ Estimated Completion

- **Phase 2** (State & Hooks): 2-3 hours
- **Phase 3** (Components): 4-5 hours  
- **Phase 4** (Cleanup): 1 hour
- **Total Remaining**: 7-9 hours of focused work

## ðŸš€ How to Continue

To resume migration:

1. Mark next todo as in-progress
2. Start with track atom migration
3. Use bridges to maintain backward compatibility
4. Test each change incrementally
5. Update todos as you complete work

The foundation is solid - remaining work is systematic refactoring with clear patterns established.
