### 2. Cross-Track Clip Dragging ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**From**: Original plan, still pending

**What to Build**:
- Drag clip from one track to another
- Visual feedback during drag
- Update clip's trackId on drop
- Handle OPFS file references

---

### 3. OPFS Visibility Tooling ‚≠ê
**From**: Original plan

**What to Build**:
- Debug panel showing OPFS contents
- File sizes, metadata
- Cleanup utilities

---

### 4. Grid Time Sections ‚≠ê
**From**: Original plan

**What to Build**:
- Create time sections (verse, chorus, etc.)
- Visual markers on grid
- Named regions

## üöÄ Immediate Action Plan

1. **Start Visual Automation Lane** (2-3 hours)
   - Create `AutomationLane.tsx` component
   - SVG path rendering from envelope points
   - Responsive to timeline zoom

2. **Integrate with Track Grid** (1-2 hours)
   - Overlay on track waveform
   - Z-index management
   - Toggle visibility per track

3. **Add Draggable Points** (2-3 hours)
   - Pointer event handlers
   - Visual feedback
   - Update envelope state on drag

4. **Test & Polish** (1 hour)
   - Performance with many points
   - Visual consistency
   - Edge cases

**Total Estimate**: 6-9 hours to Phase 2 complete
